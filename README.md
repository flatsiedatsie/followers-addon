# Followers

Allow properties to follow each other's changes, live. For example, you could:
- Have multiple lightbulbs change brightness by following closely how one lightbulb changes brightness.
- A volume control knob could be linked to the brightness of a lamp. The higher the volume, the brighter the lightbulb.
- A lightbulb's brightness could correspond with the current level of air pollution.

You can also do a reverse follow, where one value rises as another one lowers. For example:
- A lightbulb could respond to how much sunlight another sensor has detected. As the sun goes down, your light can automatically increase in brightness.

Not shown in the screen shot, but in the latest version you can select how frequently the values should 'synchronize'. Once per second or once very 10 seconds, for example.
